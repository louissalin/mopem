Mopem is a Mono parallel environment manager, allowing the user to switch easily between different mono versions. Mopem can be used to install a new environment by tracking the proper branch in the mono repository, dependencies and downloading the needed source, compiling it and installing it in /home. It can then switch environments by changing environment variables and path.

usage:

$ mopem install 2.10

will install the latest in the 2.10 branch

$ mopem install 2.10.1

will install mono 2.10.1

$ mopem install master

will install the HEAD version in the master branch

$ mopem update 2.10.1

will update the branch

$ mopem use 2.10
$ mopem use master

will switch to the selected environments

$ mopem list 

will list all the installed environments

$ mopem list available

will list all the available environments that could be installed.

Because people will want to maintain forks of certain Mono branches, mopem will read the forked git repository url from a configuration file. It will be up to the user to keep the source tree up to date.
